            and my personal favorite server administration. I arrived onboard the USS George H. W. Bush in 2018 and was assigned to work as a SysAdmin for our
            ships networks. I've been stationed onboard for four years now continuing to specialize in System Administration and Data Networking, in 2019 I

    <h3>My Percieved Calling</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>I believe that my calling on Earth is to work and develop means to have technology work better for people and to help those who need a hand get that 
            assistnace. I think that God gave me a servants heart and the ability to understand and sympathyze with many walks of life in order to better meet thier
            needs. He also gave me the ability to learn quickly about computers and the ability for those concepts to click easily with me. I hope that he can use me 
            to serve others and my family to the best of my ability.
